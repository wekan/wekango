// Self-throttle for host-CPU pressure.
//
// A client that shares the host with FerretDB can call the `throttle` command to
// (a) learn how busy FerretDB is and (b) ask it to slow down when the host CPU is
// high. While the throttle is active, every command handled sleeps a small amount
// before running, which lowers FerretDB's CPU use and yields time to other
// software on the host. The throttle self-expires, so a crashed or disconnected
// client can never leave FerretDB permanently slow.
//
// All state is process-global and lock-free (atomics), so the hot path
// (throttleApply, called for every command) is cheap.
