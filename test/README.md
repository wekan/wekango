# Test local webserver with DDoS-level traffic

Testing local webserver with DDoS-level traffic, does webserver handle it and work OK, or crash.
Do not use this to test any Internet server, it is illegal, police may contact you.

Q: When using Cosmopolitan Redbean at local Ubuntu 24.10 laptop, how to test Redbean DDoS protection locally?

A:

#### 1. Set up a Basic Redbean Application

Create a simple Redbean application with a single endpoint. This endpoint can simply return a static response.

#### 2. Simulate DDoS Traffic

Use ab (Apache Benchmark):

Install ab using:

```
sudo apt install apache2-utils
```

Run ab with a high concurrency level and request rate to simulate a large number of concurrent requests.

For example:

```
ab -n 1000 -c 100 -k -p post.txt -T "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" http://localhost:8080/your-endpoint 

# -n 1000: Number of requests
# -c 100: Number of concurrent users
# -k: Use HTTP KeepAlive
# -p post.txt: File containing POST data (if applicable)
# -T: Content-Type
```
Use wrk:

Install wrk using:

```
sudo apt install wrk
```

Run wrk with similar parameters to ab to simulate a high load. For example:

```
wrk -t12 -c100 -d30s http://localhost:8080/your-endpoint

# -t12: Number of threads
# -c100: Number of connections
# -d30s: Duration of the test (30 seconds)
```

#### 3. Monitor Redbean's Behavior

Observe Resource Usage: Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and network I/O of the Redbean application during the stress test.
Check for Error Logs: Examine Redbean's logs for any error messages or indications of overload.
Analyze Request Handling: Observe how Redbean handles the increased load. Does it start to slow down, drop requests, or exhibit other signs of being overwhelmed?

#### 4. Adjust Redbean's Configuration (if applicable)

Rate Limiting: If Redbean provides rate-limiting features, adjust the configuration to limit the number of requests per second or per IP address.
Connection Pooling: Configure connection pooling to optimize resource usage and improve performance under high load.
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the application server.

#### 5. Refine Your Test

Vary Test Parameters: Experiment with different concurrency levels, request rates, and request patterns to simulate various DDoS attack scenarios.
Use More Realistic Traffic: If possible, use tools to generate more realistic traffic patterns that mimic real-world user behavior.

#### Important Notes

Local Testing Limitations: Local testing can only provide a limited simulation of a real-world DDoS attack. It's crucial to conduct more realistic testing in a controlled environment or on a dedicated test server.
DDoS Protection is Multi-layered: Redbean's built-in protection is likely one part of a broader DDoS protection strategy. Consider additional measures such as network-level DDoS protection (e.g., using a cloud provider's DDoS protection service) and application-level security measures.
By following these steps, you can gain a better understanding of how Redbean's DDoS protection mechanisms perform under simulated load and identify areas for improvement in your application's resilience.

#### Disclaimer

This is a general guide for local testing. The specific steps and tools may vary depending on your Redbean application and your testing environment.
Always test thoroughly and responsibly to avoid impacting other systems or services.
DDoS protection is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to stay ahead of evolving threats.
